DELHI GEOGRAPHY, METEOROLOGY, AND CLIMATE — WHY DELHI TRAPS POLLUTION
=======================================================================

## Geographic Factors

### Location and Topography
- Delhi: 28.6°N, 77.2°E, elevation ~215m above sea level
- Indo-Gangetic Plain — flat alluvial terrain, no natural barriers to NW winds
- Aravalli Hills to the south (low, fragmented — don't block pollution)
- Yamuna River floodplain runs through city (low-lying, collects cold air)
- Thar Desert to the west — dust storms in summer, dry air in winter

### The "Bowl Effect"
- Delhi is surrounded by agricultural belts in all directions
- Winds from Punjab/Haryana (NW) carry stubble smoke directly
- Winds from UP/Bihar (E) can carry industrial pollution
- Mountains to the north (Himalayas, 200+ km away) — don't directly impact
- The flat terrain means no topographic dispersion of pollutants

## Meteorological Factors

### Temperature Inversions (The #1 Trapping Mechanism)
- **What:** Warm air layer sits above cold surface air, trapping pollutants near ground
- **When:** October to February, especially November–January
- **Mechanism:** Clear nights radiate heat → ground cools → cold dense air near surface → warm air above acts as lid
- **Effect:** Mixing height drops from 2-3 km (summer) to 200-500m (winter) — pollutants concentrated in thin layer
- **Duration:** Inversions form by midnight, strongest at dawn (6-8 AM), break by noon
- **This is why:** Delhi AQI is worst in early morning and improves somewhat by afternoon

### Wind Patterns
- **October–November:** NW winds (3-5 km/h) — carry stubble smoke from Punjab/Haryana
- **December–January:** Calm conditions (1-3 km/h) — stagnant air, no dispersion
- **March–May:** W/NW winds (8-15 km/h) — dust from Rajasthan
- **July–September:** SE winds (monsoon) — bring moisture, wash out pollution
- Low wind speed is the primary meteorological villain: Delhi has 60-80 "calm" days/year

### Humidity and Fog
- Delhi winter: 70-100% humidity (especially Dec–Jan)
- High humidity + PM2.5 → smog (smoke + fog)
- Fog droplets absorb pollution, create brownish haze
- Reduces visibility to < 50 meters on worst days
- Fog season: mid-December to late January
- IGI Airport: 50+ flights delayed/cancelled per fog day in peak season

### Boundary Layer Height
Month     | Avg Mixing Height (m) | Effect on Pollution
January   | 300-500               | Severe trapping
February  | 500-800               | High trapping
March     | 1000-1500             | Moderate dispersion
April     | 1500-2500             | Good dispersion
May       | 2000-3000             | Best dispersion
June      | 2000-2800             | Good dispersion
July      | 1500-2000             | Good (rain helps)
August    | 1200-1800             | Good (rain + wind)
September | 1000-1500             | Transition
October   | 600-1000              | Trapping begins
November  | 300-600               | Severe trapping
December  | 300-500               | Severe trapping

### Rainfall Pattern
- Total annual rainfall: ~800 mm (concentrated in monsoon)
- July–September: 75% of annual rainfall
- October–March: Almost no rain — zero washout of pollutants
- First significant rain after monsoon: typically March
- This dry winter = 5 months of pollutant accumulation

## Climate Change Impact on Delhi Air Quality

### Temperature Rise
- Delhi has warmed ~1.5°C since 1960s
- More intense heat waves in summer → more ground-level ozone
- Warmer nights in winter may slightly weaken inversions (but offset by more emissions)

### Changed Monsoon Patterns
- Delayed monsoon onset (reaching Delhi later in June/July)
- More intense but shorter rainfall events
- Extended dry spells between rain events
- Post-monsoon transition happening faster → earlier pollution season

### Increased Extreme Events
- More dust storms in April-June (Rajasthan desertification)
- More intense stubble burning season (shorter window due to late monsoon)
- Western disturbances bringing more fog episodes in winter

## Delhi's Microclimate Zones

### Urban Heat Island
- Delhi city centre is 3-5°C warmer than rural NCR
- Concrete, asphalt absorb heat → no nighttime cooling
- Fewer trees in dense areas → no evapotranspiration cooling
- Impact on air quality: higher temperatures → more ozone formation

### Green vs Built-up Zones
Area              | Green Cover | Typical AQI Impact
Ridge Forest      | 90%         | 15-25% lower AQI than surroundings
Delhi Cantonment  | 60%         | 10-15% lower
South Delhi       | 25%         | Average
Central Delhi     | 15%         | 10-15% higher
Industrial areas  | <5%         | 20-30% higher
Anand Vihar area  | 10%         | Worst in Delhi (bus terminal + traffic)

## Why Other Cities Don't Suffer as Much

### Mumbai vs Delhi
- Mumbai: Coastal — sea breeze disperses pollution daily
- Higher winds year-round (8-12 km/h vs Delhi's 3-5 km/h)
- No inland agricultural burning sources
- Fewer temperature inversions (maritime climate moderates)
- Still polluted, but AQI typically 100-200 vs Delhi's 200-500

### Beijing vs Delhi
- Beijing: Similar geography (flat plains)
- Had similar pollution levels in 2013-2015 (AQI 400+)
- Massive government intervention:
  - Coal ban within city limits
  - Industry relocation
  - Steel/power plant shutdowns
  - ¥100+ billion investment
  - Result: PM2.5 dropped 50% from 2013 to 2023
- Delhi can learn from Beijing's approach

### Lahore vs Delhi
- Similar geography and climate (Indo-Gangetic Plain)
- Similar pollution levels (sometimes worse than Delhi)
- Receives same stubble burning smoke from Indian Punjab
- Less monitoring infrastructure, fewer interventions
- Cross-border pollution is a shared problem

## Air Quality Monitoring Infrastructure

### CPCB Network in Delhi
- 40+ Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS)
- Real-time data published on CPCB app and website
- Parameters: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3
- Data quality: Generally reliable, some stations face maintenance issues

### SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting)
- Run by IITM Pune + Ministry of Earth Sciences
- 10 stations in Delhi
- Provides 48-hour AQI forecasts
- Emission inventory based predictions
- Website: safar.tropmet.res.in

### Independent Monitoring
- US Embassy monitor at Chanakyapuri (independent reference)
- IQAir PurpleAir sensors — citizen science network
- OpenAQ aggregates data from government and independent sensors
- Often discrepancies between government and independent readings (10-30%)
