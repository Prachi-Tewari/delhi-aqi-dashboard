AQI CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES — INDIA, US EPA, AND WHO
========================================================

## India National Air Quality Index (NAQI)

### Overview
- Launched by CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) in 2014
- Based on 8 pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, Pb
- Primary 6 pollutants used for real-time AQI: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3
- Scale: 0–500 in 6 categories
- Method: Sub-index interpolation, AQI = max(all sub-indices)

### Categories
- 0–50: Good (green) — Minimal health impact
- 51–100: Satisfactory — Minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people
- 101–200: Moderate — Breathing discomfort to people with lung disease
- 201–300: Poor — Breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure  
- 301–400: Very Poor — Respiratory illness on prolonged exposure
- 401–500: Severe — Health impact even on light physical work

### Breakpoint Table (24-hour average, µg/m³ unless noted)
PM2.5: 0-30 (Good), 31-60 (Satisfactory), 61-90 (Moderate), 91-120 (Poor), 121-250 (Very Poor), 250+ (Severe)
PM10:  0-50, 51-100, 101-250, 251-350, 351-430, 430+
NO2:   0-40, 41-80, 81-180, 181-280, 281-400, 400+
SO2:   0-40, 41-80, 81-380, 381-800, 801-1600, 1600+
CO:    0-1.0, 1.1-2.0, 2.1-10, 10.1-17, 17.1-34, 34+ (mg/m³)
O3:    0-50, 51-100, 101-168, 169-208, 209-748, 748+ (8-hr avg)

### Sub-index Calculation Formula
I = ((I_hi - I_lo) / (C_hi - C_lo)) × (C - C_lo) + I_lo
Where:
- I = sub-index for the pollutant
- C = actual concentration
- C_lo, C_hi = concentration breakpoints bracketing C
- I_lo, I_hi = AQI breakpoints corresponding to C_lo and C_hi

## US EPA AQI

### Key Differences from India NAQI
- Scale: 0–500 (same range)
- 6 categories but different breakpoints
- Different averaging periods for some pollutants
- PM2.5 breakpoints are stricter (lower thresholds)
- Uses NowCast algorithm for real-time with weighted averaging

### US EPA Categories
- 0–50: Good (green)
- 51–100: Moderate (yellow)  
- 101–150: Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (orange)
- 151–200: Unhealthy (red)
- 201–300: Very Unhealthy (purple)
- 301–500: Hazardous (maroon)

### PM2.5 Breakpoints Comparison (µg/m³, 24-hr)
India Good:  0–30     vs  US Good: 0–12.0
India Satis: 31–60    vs  US Moderate: 12.1–35.4
India Mod:   61–90    vs  US USG: 35.5–55.4
India Poor:  91–120   vs  US Unhealthy: 55.5–150.4
India VPoor: 121–250  vs  US Very Unhealthy: 150.5–250.4
India Severe:250+     vs  US Hazardous: 250.5+

Note: Delhi's "Satisfactory" (51-100) would be "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" on the US scale in many cases.

## WHO Air Quality Guidelines (2021 Update)

### Annual Mean Targets
PM2.5: 5 µg/m³ (was 10, tightened in 2021)
PM10:  15 µg/m³ (was 20)
NO2:   10 µg/m³ (was 40)
SO2:   No annual guideline (24-hr only)
O3:    60 µg/m³ peak season

### 24-hour Mean Targets
PM2.5: 15 µg/m³ (was 25)
PM10:  45 µg/m³ (was 50)
NO2:   25 µg/m³
SO2:   40 µg/m³
O3:    100 µg/m³ (8-hr)
CO:    4 mg/m³ (24-hr)

### Delhi vs WHO 2021
Delhi's annual PM2.5 (~95 µg/m³) is 19× the WHO annual guideline (5 µg/m³).
Delhi's annual PM10 (~230 µg/m³) is 15× the WHO guideline (15 µg/m³).
Even Delhi's BEST month (August, ~40 µg/m³ PM2.5) exceeds WHO 24-hr limit (15 µg/m³) by 2.7×.

## Pollutant Details

### PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter)
- Diameter: ≤2.5 micrometres (1/30th of human hair)
- Can penetrate deep into lungs and enter bloodstream
- Sources: combustion (vehicles, biomass, industry), secondary aerosols
- Delhi sources: vehicular exhaust (28%), biomass burning (25%), 
  industrial processes (18%), dust/construction (15%), secondary aerosols (14%)
- Most dangerous pollutant for health — linked to 99% of AQI-related deaths

### PM10 (Coarse Particulate Matter)
- Diameter: ≤10 micrometres
- Trapped in upper respiratory tract
- Sources: road dust (35%), construction (25%), natural dust (20%), industry (20%)
- Delhi is one of the dustiest cities due to geography and construction

### NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide)
- Reddish-brown gas with sharp odour
- Sources: vehicle exhaust (70%), power plants (15%), industry (15%)
- Indicator of traffic pollution intensity
- Forms ground-level ozone in sunlight
- Delhi NO2 levels: ~40–80 µg/m³ (highest at ITO, Anand Vihar)

### SO2 (Sulphur Dioxide)
- Produced by burning fossil fuels containing sulphur
- Sources: coal-based power (55%), industry (30%), vehicles (15%)
- Delhi levels relatively low (~10–20 µg/m³) due to low-sulphur fuel mandates
- Contributes to acid rain and secondary PM2.5

### CO (Carbon Monoxide)
- Odorless, colourless toxic gas
- Sources: incomplete combustion — vehicles (65%), biomass (20%), industry (15%)
- Binds to haemoglobin 200× more strongly than oxygen
- Delhi levels: 1–3 mg/m³ (generally within limits)

### O3 (Ground-level Ozone)
- NOT directly emitted — formed when NOx + VOCs react in sunlight
- Worst in summer months (May–June) during peak sunshine
- Damages lung tissue, triggers asthma
- Delhi O3 rising trend: climate change + more precursor emissions
- Peak hours: 12 PM – 4 PM

## Global City Comparison (Annual PM2.5, µg/m³)

Stockholm, Sweden | 5      | 1×
Helsinki, Finland | 4.5    | 0.9× (meets WHO)

Delhi consistently ranks in the top 5 most polluted capital cities globally.
