=== SECTION 1: SOURCE APPORTIONMENT OF DELHI'S PM2.5 ===

Multiple source apportionment studies have been conducted for Delhi using receptor models (PMF, CMB) and emission inventories. The consensus from IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, TERI, and NEERI studies:

ANNUAL AVERAGE SOURCE CONTRIBUTION TO PM2.5:
1. Vehicular emissions: 20–28%
   - Exhaust: Diesel vehicles dominate (trucks, buses, 3-wheelers)
   - Non-exhaust: Tire wear, brake dust, road abrasion
   - Delhi has 12.5 million registered vehicles (2025), growing by 500+/day
   - Diesel trucks entering Delhi at night contribute disproportionately

2. Industrial emissions: 18–25%
   - Brick kilns in NCR (2,000+ kilns within 100 km of Delhi)
   - Small-scale industries in Anand Parbat, Wazirpur, Mundka
   - Thermal power plants in NCR (Dadri, Jhajjar, Faridabad)
   - Coal and petroleum coke burning

3. Dust (construction + road): 15–20%
   - Construction projects: 60,000+ active sites in Delhi NCR
   - Road dust re-suspension: Unpaved shoulders, broken roads
   - Anti-smog guns and windbreaks partially effective
   - Dust contribution increases in summer due to dry conditions

4. Biomass/waste burning: 10–18%
   - Open waste burning at landfills (Ghazipur, Bhalswa, Okhla)
   - Household biomass cooking (urban poor areas)
   - Cremation ghats
   - Contribution doubles in winter due to heating needs

5. Crop stubble burning (seasonal): 5–40%
   - October–November: 15–40% of Delhi's PM2.5
   - December onwards: <5% as burning season ends
   - Fire counts: 70,000–80,000 fires annually in Punjab/Haryana/Western UP
   - Prevailing NW winds carry smoke directly to Delhi-NCR
   - Despite government intervention (Pusa bio-decomposer, subsidized machines), >50% farmers still burn

6. Secondary formation: 10–15%
   - SO2 → sulfate aerosols
   - NOx + VOCs → secondary organic aerosols + ozone
   - Ammonia (from agriculture, waste) + sulfuric acid → ammonium sulfate particles
   - Significant in winter when photochemistry and conversion rates change

SEASONAL VARIATION IN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS:
| Season      | Vehicles | Industry | Dust   | Biomass | Stubble | Secondary |
|-------------|----------|----------|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Winter      | 22%      | 20%      | 8%     | 15%     | 25%     | 10%      |
| Summer      | 25%      | 22%      | 25%    | 8%      | 0%      | 20%      |
| Monsoon     | 30%      | 18%      | 5%     | 10%     | 0%      | 12%      |
| Post-monsoon| 20%      | 18%      | 10%    | 12%     | 30%     | 10%      |

=== SECTION 2: METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS ===

TEMPERATURE INVERSION:
The single most important meteorological factor for Delhi's winter pollution crisis.
- Normal: Warm air near ground rises, carrying pollutants upward → dispersion
- Inversion: Cold air trapped near ground with warm air lid above → pollutants accumulate
- Delhi experiences 80–100 inversion days per year (October–February)
- Inversion height drops to 200–400m during peak winter (vs 1,500–3,000m in summer)
- Effectively creates an atmospheric "lid" concentrating pollutants

WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION:
- Winter: Calm conditions (wind speed <2 m/s) for 60–70% of days
- NW winds bring stubble burning smoke from Punjab/Haryana
- Easterly winds bring industrial pollution from UP industrial belt
- Summer/monsoon: Stronger winds (5–15 m/s) from SE provide natural ventilation

HUMIDITY AND FOG:
- Winter humidity: 70–95% during night/early morning
- Fog + PM = toxic "smog" — visibility <200m, PM2.5 spikes
- Water droplets absorb pollutants, creating acidic fog harmful to lungs
- Fog acts as secondary inversion layer, further trapping pollutants

RAINFALL:
- Monsoon: 600–800mm rainfall washes out particles (wet deposition)
- Winter: Negligible rainfall → no natural cleaning
- A single heavy rain event can reduce AQI from 300+ to <100 within hours

MIXING HEIGHT:
- Summer: 1,500–3,000m → good vertical mixing, dispersion
- Winter: 200–500m → poor mixing, pollutant accumulation
- Dawn: Lowest mixing height → morning AQI peaks
- Afternoon: Highest mixing height → temporary improvement

=== SECTION 3: GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND INITIATIVES ===

GRADED RESPONSE ACTION PLAN (GRAP) — Revised 2024:
Stage I (AQI 201–300, "Poor"):
- Dust mitigation at construction sites mandatory
- No burning of waste, biomass, leaves
- Mechanized road sweeping
- Strict PUC (Pollution Under Control) enforcement

Stage II (AQI 301–400, "Very Poor"):
- Diesel generators banned (except hospitals, data centers)
- Coal/firewood use banned in restaurants (tandoors)
- Water sprinkling on major roads
- Parking fees increased to discourage private cars

Stage III (AQI 401–450, "Severe"):
- All construction/demolition banned
- Brick kilns, stone crushers shut down
- Non-essential diesel trucks banned from entering Delhi
- Government offices: 50% work from home

Stage IV (AQI >450, "Severe+"):
- Emergency measures — schools closed, go online
- Private cars restricted (odd-even scheme)
- State governments may halt non-essential vehicles
- Additional water sprinkling from helicopters
- Industries in NCR ordered to shut

NATIONAL CLEAN AIR PROGRAMME (NCAP):
- Target: 40% reduction in PM2.5/PM10 concentration by 2026 from 2017 baseline
- 131 non-attainment cities identified
- City-specific clean air action plans
- Progress (2024): Delhi achieved ~15–20% reduction in annual PM (disputed figures)

ELECTRIC VEHICLE POLICY (Delhi):
- Target: 25% of new registrations to be EVs by 2024
- Subsidies: Up to ₹1.5 lakh for cars, ₹30,000 for 2-wheelers
- 6,500+ EV charging points planned
- 300+ electric buses inducted into DTC fleet
- Road tax exemption for EVs

SMOG TOWERS:
- Two smog towers installed (Connaught Place, Anand Vihar)
- Each cost ₹20+ crore
- Effectiveness disputed: IIT Bombay study found negligible impact beyond 50m radius
- Scale is insufficient for a city of 1,500+ sq km

ODD-EVEN SCHEME:
- First implemented January 2016, repeated in 2019, 2024
- Private cars with odd/even number plates alternate driving days
- 10–15% reduction in vehicular PM during implementation
- Controversial: Exemptions (women, CNG, electric, 2-wheelers) reduce effectiveness
- Compliance monitoring challenges

=== SECTION 4: COMPARISON WITH OTHER CITIES ===

| City          | Annual PM2.5 (µg/m³) | AQI Standard | Key Sources |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Delhi         | 90–120               | India NAQI   | Vehicles, industry, stubble |
| Beijing       | 30–40                | China AQI    | Industry, heating, vehicles |
| Los Angeles   | 10–15                | US AQI       | Vehicles, wildfires |
| London        | 10–12                | DAQI (UK)    | Vehicles, heating |
| Lahore        | 80–100               | Pakistan AQI | Industry, vehicles, crop burning |
| Dhaka         | 70–90                | Bangladesh   | Industry, vehicles, brick kilns |

Delhi has reduced its PM2.5 from 150+ (2015) to 90–120 (2025), a ~25% improvement driven primarily by CNG conversion, BS-VI fuels, and industrial relocation. However, this is still 6–8× WHO guidelines.

Beijing achieved dramatic improvement: from 90 (2013) to 30 (2025) through aggressive coal ban, factory shutdowns, and electric transport — often cited as a model Delhi should follow.

=== SECTION 5: FUTURE OUTLOOK AND PREDICTIONS ===

OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO (2030):
- Full NCAP implementation + stringent GRAP enforcement
- 30% EV adoption in Delhi
- Complete stubble burning elimination
- Projected PM2.5: 50–60 µg/m³ (still 3–4× WHO)

BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIO (2030):
- Marginal improvements offset by growing population/vehicles
- Projected PM2.5: 70–80 µg/m³
- Severe winter episodes continue

PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO (2030):
- Climate change increases inversion frequency and duration
- Urban sprawl accelerates
- NCR industrialization continues unchecked
- Projected PM2.5: 80–100 µg/m³

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT:
- Rising temperatures will increase ozone formation
- More frequent temperature inversions predicted
- Changing monsoon patterns may reduce rainfall days
- Heat waves combined with pollution create compound health emergencies
- Dust storms from an expanding Thar Desert will increase PM10
