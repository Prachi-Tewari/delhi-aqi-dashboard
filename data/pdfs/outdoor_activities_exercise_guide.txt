DELHI AIR POLLUTION — OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES, EXERCISE, AND DAILY LIFE GUIDANCE
=============================================================================

## Is It Safe to Exercise Outdoors in Delhi?

### General Guidelines by AQI Level

**AQI 0–50 (Good):**
- All outdoor activities safe for everyone
- Ideal for running, cycling, sports, yoga in parks
- Best time: early morning (6–8 AM) or after sunset

**AQI 51–100 (Satisfactory):**
- Safe for most people
- Sensitive individuals (asthma, COPD, children, elderly) should monitor symptoms
- Outdoor exercise OK but avoid peak traffic hours (8–10 AM, 5–8 PM)

**AQI 101–200 (Moderate):**
- Reduce prolonged outdoor exertion
- Shift to less intense activities (walking instead of running)
- Children and elderly should limit outdoor play to 30 minutes
- Best hours: 11 AM – 3 PM (pollution often lower midday)
- Indoor gym preferred for intense workouts

**AQI 201–300 (Poor):**
- AVOID outdoor exercise entirely
- All workouts should be indoor with air purification
- Schools should cancel outdoor sports/PE
- Walking commuters should wear N95 masks
- Keep windows closed, use air purifiers

**AQI 301–400 (Very Poor):**
- NO outdoor physical activity
- Even walking outdoors triggers respiratory stress
- Work from home if possible
- N95 mask mandatory for any outdoor exposure
- Cancel outdoor events, weddings, celebrations

**AQI 400+ (Severe):**
- HEALTH EMERGENCY — minimize ALL outdoor exposure
- Seal doors and windows with wet towels
- Air purifier on maximum, ideally in bedroom
- If you must go out: N95 mask + minimal time
- Monitor for symptoms: breathlessness, chest pain, dizziness

## Best Times for Outdoor Activity in Delhi

### By Season
- **Winter (Nov–Feb):** Best: 12 PM – 3 PM (inversions break). Worst: 6–10 AM, after 6 PM
- **Summer (Mar–Jun):** Best: 6–8 AM (before heat + ozone). Avoid: 12–4 PM (ozone peak)
- **Monsoon (Jul–Sep):** Best anytime — cleanest air.  Post-rain hours especially good.
- **October:** Mornings still OK early month, deteriorates by Diwali week

### By Location in Delhi
- **Best areas:** Lodhi Garden, Sunder Nursery, Buddha Jayanti Park, JNU campus, 
  Ridge areas, Hauz Khas Deer Park — green cover helps filter some PM
- **Worst areas:** Near ring roads, Anand Vihar, ITO intersection, 
  Mundka industrial area, near construction sites
- Running along main roads increases PM exposure by 3–5× compared to parks

## Indoor Air Quality Tips

### Air Purifiers
- HEPA (H13 or H14) filter — removes 99.97% of particles ≥0.3µm
- Recommended CADR: 150+ m³/h for small room, 350+ for living room
- Run 24/7 during winter months (October–February)
- Replace filters every 6–12 months (faster in Delhi)
- Budget options: Coway, MI Air Purifier effective for Delhi conditions
- DIY: Box fan + MERV-13 filter (Corsi-Rosenthal box) — 60-70% as effective

### Houseplants (Limited Effect)
- NASA studies show plants filter some VOCs
- Snake plant, peace lily, spider plant popular choices
- Reality: you'd need 10-20 plants per room for measurable PM2.5 reduction
- Better than nothing but NOT a substitute for HEPA purifier

### Ventilation Strategy
- Keep windows CLOSED when AQI > 200
- Ventilate during lowest-AQI hours (typically 1–3 PM in winter)
- Use exhaust fans in kitchen while cooking (cooking generates PM2.5)
- Cross-ventilation during monsoon season (cleanest air)

## Masks — Which Work?

### N95/FFP2 Masks
- Filter 95% of particles ≥0.3µm
- EFFECTIVE against PM2.5
- Must fit snugly — facial hair reduces effectiveness
- Replace after ~40 hours of use in Delhi pollution
- Brands available: 3M 9504, Venus V-44, Honeywell

### KN95 Masks
- Chinese standard, ~94% filtration
- Slightly less reliable fit than N95
- Acceptable alternative when N95 unavailable

### Cloth/Surgical Masks
- INEFFECTIVE against PM2.5
- May block some PM10 (large particles)
- Do NOT rely on these during Poor/Severe AQI

### Mask Tips for Delhi
- Carry a mask always during October–February
- Keep spare in car, bag, office
- Children's N95 masks available — important for school commute
- Those with breathing difficulty: consult doctor for mask alternatives

## Vulnerable Groups — Special Precautions

### Children (0-14 years)
- Breathe faster → inhale more pollutants per body weight
- Developing lungs more susceptible to damage
- Delhi children have 40% lower lung function than WHO-normal (AIIMS study)
- Schools should have air purifiers in every classroom
- Cancel outdoor play when AQI > 200

### Elderly (60+ years)
- Reduced respiratory capacity
- Higher risk of cardiac events from PM2.5
- Stay indoors when AQI > 150
- Regular check-ups during winter months
- Keep emergency medications (inhaler, heart meds) accessible

### Pregnant Women
- PM2.5 exposure linked to low birth weight, preterm birth
- Avoid outdoor exposure when AQI > 150
- Use air purifier in bedroom and living room
- Take antioxidant-rich diet (fruits, vegetables)

### Asthma/COPD Patients
- Keep rescue inhaler at all times
- Start preventive medication before winter season (consult pulmonologist)
- Monitor peak flow readings daily during pollution season
- Consider leaving Delhi during worst weeks (Nov first 2 weeks)

## Economic Impact on Daily Life

- Average Delhi household spends ₹3,000–8,000/month on air purifiers + electricity
- Health costs: ₹15,000–50,000/year additional for pollution-related illness
- Lost work days: 2.5 days/year average due to pollution sickness
- Property values: 5-8% lower in high-pollution areas vs green zones
- Tourism: 20% decline in foreign tourists during Nov–Jan

## Food and Nutrition During High Pollution

### Protective Foods
- **Vitamin C:** Amla, citrus fruits, bell peppers — antioxidant protection
- **Vitamin E:** Almonds, sunflower seeds — reduces oxidative stress
- **Omega-3:** Fish, flaxseeds, walnuts — anti-inflammatory
- **Turmeric:** Curcumin has anti-inflammatory properties
- **Jaggery (gur):** Traditional remedy, helps clear lungs (ayurvedic)
- **Tulsi tea:** Antimicrobial, clears respiratory passages

### Foods to Avoid
- Fried/processed foods (increase inflammation)  
- Excessive dairy during peak pollution (may increase mucus)
- Street food during Severe AQI (exposed to ambient PM)

### Hydration
- Drink 8–10 glasses of warm water daily
- Steam inhalation 2× daily during peak pollution
- Honey + warm water — soothes throat
