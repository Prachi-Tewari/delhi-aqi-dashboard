STUBBLE BURNING, TRANSPORT, AND INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION — DELHI'S KEY SOURCES
============================================================================

## Source Apportionment of Delhi's PM2.5 (TERI/ARAI 2023 Study)

### Annual Average Contribution
Source Category          | % of PM2.5 | Peak Season
Vehicular emissions      | 28%        | Year-round
Biomass/stubble burning  | 25%        | Oct–Nov (up to 46%)
Industrial processes     | 18%        | Year-round
Road & construction dust | 15%        | Mar–Jun (dust storms)
Domestic cooking/heating | 8%         | Winter (wood/coal use)
Secondary aerosols       | 6%         | Winter (atmospheric chemistry)

Note: During November peak, stubble burning can contribute up to 40-46% of Delhi's PM2.5.

## Stubble Burning — The Biggest Seasonal Contributor

### What Is It?
- After rice (kharif) harvest in October, farmers burn paddy stubble to clear fields
- ~20 million tonnes of crop residue burned annually in Punjab and Haryana
- 2–3 week window between rice harvest and wheat sowing (tight timeline)
- Each fire produces PM2.5, PM10, CO, CO2, black carbon, VOCs
- Satellite data (NASA FIRMS) shows 20,000–80,000 fire events in Oct–Nov

### Scale of the Problem
- Punjab: ~15,000+ fires/day at peak (2023: ~36,000 total fires)
- Haryana: ~8,000+ fires/day at peak
- Wind patterns carry smoke directly to Delhi (NW winds in autumn)
- 150–300 km distance means smoke arrives within hours
- Contributes 20-46% of Delhi PM2.5 during Oct–Nov

### Why Farmers Burn
- Only 15–20 day gap between rice harvest and wheat sowing
- Mechanical alternatives (Happy Seeder) cost ₹1.5–2 lakh
- Government subsidies cover only 50–80% of equipment cost
- Small/marginal farmers (< 2 acres) can't afford machines
- Burning is free and takes only 2–3 hours per acre
- Manual clearing would require 20+ labour-days per acre (unavailable/expensive)

### Government Response to Stubble Burning
- Supreme Court ban on stubble burning (2015, largely unenforceable)
- CRM (Crop Residue Management) scheme: ₹3,000 crore budget since 2018
- In-situ solutions: Happy Seeder, SMS (Straw Management System), rotavator
- Ex-situ solutions: Bio-CNG plants, pellet fuel, cardboard manufacturing
- Fines: ₹2,500–15,000 per incident (rarely collected in practice)
- Satellite monitoring by ISRO — real-time fire counts shared with states
- Progress: Fire counts reduced ~30% from 2016 to 2024, but still massive

## Vehicular Pollution — Delhi's Constant Source

### Vehicle Fleet
- Delhi has ~12 million registered vehicles (2024)
- Highest vehicle density in India: ~550 vehicles per km of road
- Daily 50,000+ trucks transit through Delhi (especially at night)
- 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers: 65% of fleet, significant PM/CO contribution
- Auto-rickshaws increasingly CNG but old ones still diesel

### Key Vehicular Pollutants
- PM2.5: Diesel exhaust (trucks, buses, gensets)
- NOx: All internal combustion engines, especially diesel
- CO: Petrol vehicles with poor catalytic converters
- VOCs: Evaporative emissions from petrol, painting, solvents
- Black carbon: Diesel soot — powerful climate and health pollutant

### Interventions
- **BS-VI fuel standards** (April 2020): Equivalent to Euro VI, 80% PM reduction
- **CNG conversion**: All buses, autos (since 2001), now extending to trucks
- **Metro expansion**: ~400 km network, carries 6 million/day (reduces road traffic)
- **EV push**: Delhi EV Policy 2020 — 25% new vehicles electric by 2024
  - EV registrations up 300% from 2021 to 2024
  - Charging infrastructure: 2,000+ stations planned
- **Odd-even scheme**: Periodic vehicle rationing (implemented 2016, 2019)
  - Mixed results: 5-10% AQI improvement when enforced
- **Peripheral expressways**: Eastern/Western peripheral expressways divert trucks

## Industrial Pollution

### NCR Industrial Profile
- ~8,000 industries in Delhi, ~50,000 in NCR (including Noida, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad)
- Major sectors: textiles, chemicals, metals, food processing
- Many small-scale industries lack pollution controls
- Thermal power plants: Badarpur (closed 2018), Dadri, Jhajjar still operate

### Key Interventions
- **Relocation of industries** from residential Delhi (since 1996 SC order)
- **Closure of Badarpur thermal plant** (2018) — one of India's most polluting
- **PNG piping** to industries replacing coal/furnace oil
- **Real-time emission monitoring** (CEMS) mandatory for large industries
- **GRAP restrictions** close polluting industries during Severe episodes

## Construction Dust

### Scale
- Delhi NCR: ~60,000+ active construction sites
- Major projects: Metro Phase IV, Central Vista, real estate boom
- Construction dust = 15-20% of PM10, 5-10% of PM2.5
- Unpaved roads contribute another 10-15% of PM10

### Regulations
- Anti-smog guns mandatory at large construction sites
- Green netting, water sprinkling required
- Construction ban during GRAP Stage 3-4 (AQI 400+)
- Mechanical road sweeping by MCD (coverage still low)

## GRAP — Graded Response Action Plan

### Stage 1 (AQI 201-300: Poor)
- Close coal/wood-based food stalls
- Enforce dust control at construction sites
- Water sprinkling on roads intensified
- Enforce no-burning rules

### Stage 2 (AQI 301-400: Very Poor)
- Ban diesel generators (except emergency)
- Restrict coal use in NCR
- Enhance parking fees to discourage private vehicles
- Deploy anti-smog guns at hotspots

### Stage 3 (AQI 401-450: Severe)
- Ban all construction and demolition
- Halt mining operations in NCR
- Class 5/6 students shift to online classes
- Ban non-essential diesel trucks entering Delhi

### Stage 4 (AQI 450+: Severe+)
- Ban entry of ALL trucks (except essentials)
- 50% government staff work from home
- All classes up to 12 shift online
- Stop all construction work in NCR
- Consider odd-even vehicle rationing

## Long-term Government Initiatives

- Focus: monitoring network, scientific studies, enforcement

### Delhi's Clean Air Action Plan
- 14-point plan including electric buses (1,500+ ordered)
- Tree plantation drive: target 33% green cover
- Smog towers (experimental) at Connaught Place and Anand Vihar
  - Results: limited impact, ~10-15% PM reduction within 1 km radius
- Dust suppression: 150+ anti-smog guns, mechanical sweepers
- Real-time AQI monitoring: 40+ CAAQMS stations in Delhi

### Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) — 2021
