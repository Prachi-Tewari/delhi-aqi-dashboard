## Seasonal AQI Patterns

### Winter (October–February): WORST season
- Average AQI: 350–500+ (Very Poor to Severe)
- Peak pollution: November (Diwali + stubble burning)
- PM2.5 regularly exceeds 300 µg/m³ (20× WHO limit)
- Temperature inversions trap pollutants near ground
- Key events: Diwali fireworks (late Oct/Nov), paddy stubble burning (Oct–Nov)
- Delhi's worst recorded AQI: 999 on November 5, 2016 (post-Diwali)
- January fog season: low winds + high humidity = smog

### Summer (March–June): MODERATE
- Average AQI: 150–250 (Moderate to Poor)
- Dust storms from Rajasthan (May–June) spike PM10
- High temperatures increase ground-level ozone
- Construction activity peaks

### Monsoon (July–September): BEST season
- Average AQI: 80–150 (Satisfactory to Moderate)
- Rain washes out particulates
- Higher wind speeds disperse pollutants
- Lowest PM2.5 readings of the year
- Some flooding disrupts monitoring stations

### Post-monsoon (October): TRANSITION
- AQI rapidly climbs from ~100 to 300+ within weeks
- Stubble burning begins in Punjab/Haryana
- Temperature drops, inversions start forming
- Festival season fireworks contribute

## 10-Year Trend Analysis
- Delhi PM2.5 has declined ~25% from 2015 to 2024
- PM10 declined ~25% over same period
- NO2 relatively stable (vehicular growth offsets controls)
- SO2 significantly reduced (cleaner fuels, industry relocation)
- O3 increasing trend (climate change, photochemistry)
- Overall AQI improving slowly but still 4-6× above WHO guidelines
- COVID-19 lockdown (2020) showed ~35% improvement, demonstrating potential
